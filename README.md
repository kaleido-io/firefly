# Hyperledger FireFly

This fork of Hyperledger FireFly is used by Kaleido developers to house branches based off of the upstream's
`main` branch. The `main` branch of this fork is not used for open-source development, and as a result
we have stopped keeping it up-to-date with the upstream and have removed all code within it to make that
clear.
